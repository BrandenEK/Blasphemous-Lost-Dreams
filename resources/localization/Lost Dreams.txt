gfname: Miniature Bloody Helmet
gfdesc: A pointed helmet, worn by the penitents of the Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow. Identical to all others like it, but still the relic sticks out in the world, like it doesn’t belong where it is. Passively increases the health and fervor gained from picking up your guilt fragment.
gflore: The Eldest Brother sits in his chamber, bleeding from the wound on his side. He grabs a pouch of sand and soaks it in his blood, before placing it in the room and painfully standing up. He has broken his oath, soon the Miracle will punish him. He hears the sound of death outside his chambers, as his brothers are slaughtered endlessly by the soldiers of the Anointed Legion. He wishes he could help them, he so badly wants to stop this madness. But he knows the wishes of the Miracle, they have to die. \n\nHe has to die. \n\nWith a pained step, the Eldest Brother removes his helmet, caked in the blood of his fallen brethren, and sets it down. He slowly steps out onto the battlefield. All around him people are falling silently. In the sea of carnage and death there is not a single scream to be heard, only the sound of weapons, thunder, and bodies hitting the floor. The Eldest Brother looks up at the Father who watches the massacre below, and with a final nod, lets himself be taken by the Miracle… \n\nDeogracias slowly enters the ruins of the Brotherhood, careful not to attract the warden's attention. He enters the chamber of the eldest brother and picks up his bloodied helmet. With a sigh, he turns, locking the chamber behind him.
